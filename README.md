# EC_net

EC_net is for Electronic Medical Records (EMR) or Clinical Data to be immutably transferred to a desired entity or entities, by using blockchain and smart contracts such as owner consent contracts and NFTs.

A problem in today's healthcare systems is the lack of control of patient data and access to patient data by the patient. The lack of control and ease of access delays patient care and is a missed opportunity in patient data analysis that benefits the patient. Blockchain provides the infrastructure allowing the patient to control their data in a secure and trusted manner, thus the inception of EC_net. The build of EC_net incorporates solidity smart contracts, IPFS, and ERC721.
